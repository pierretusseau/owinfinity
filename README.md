## How is build Owinfinity.com

First the website has been build to be used by anyone even without any knowledge in HTML and CSS. To maintain and add new characters easily (it takes ~15min for a new char).

To achieve that I decided to use ACF to give me a way to display forms the way I needed it on the backend UI, then just looped and built templates by getting ACF results from the char page.

## TO-DO List of big features to come

- [x] Handle the creation of new characters
- [ ] Activate a panel on a char page (and URL Feedback)
- [ ] Integrate SVG Animations (Blog name, home page)
- [ ] Add some easter eggs (Konami code, whatever)
- [ ] Setup the website for new languages
- [ ] Improve video in background for low connections
- [ ] Mobile version
- [ ] Many improvements to load time
- [ ] Blog and dynamism around the community
